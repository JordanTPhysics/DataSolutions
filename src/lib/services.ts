            There are many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve math, programming, and curiosity about data.
            New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.
            Knowledgeable data scientists are in high demand. Jobs in data science pays high salaries for skilled workers.
            The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.
            Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. 
            Some key data science related terms you learned in this lesson include: outliers, model, algorithms, JSON, XML. CSV, and regression.`

         Data pulled in from distributed sources is consolidated to provide clear and fast business intellingence.
         Dashboards typically display KPIs, metrics, and performance scorecards using charts, tables, and aggregated data like totals and averages.
         Pathfinder expertise will create a bespoke dashboard that will help you make informed decisions and drive your business forward.`

            The five cloud computing characteristics are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,   rapid elasticity, and measured service. 
            Data mining has a six-step process: goal setting, selecting data sources, preprocessing, transforming, mining, and evaluation. 
            The availability of so many disparate amounts of data created by people, tools, and machines requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to drive transformation.
            Deep learning utilizes neural networks to teach itself patterns in inputs and outputs. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to learn about data and make predictions without explicitly programming the analysis methods into the system.   
            Regression identifies the strength and amount of the correlation between one or more inputs and an output.
            Skills involved in processing Big Data include the application of statistics, machine learning models, and some computer programming.
            Generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence, focuses on producing new data rather than just analyzing existing data. It allows machines to create content, including images, music, language, computer code, and more, mimicking creations by people.`
